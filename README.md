# N-other Angular WebApp Creator - [NAWAC]

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/nawac.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/nawac/)

Create beautiful and complex webapp based on angular framework.
WebApp support socket.io server defined easily, and some useful features as ui-router, ngTouch, drag-n-drop, tooltips...

Gulp tasks loaded by default allow you to create controllers, states, views, templates and components really easily with few clicks. Everything is then correctly connected to be used right away.

A touch of css is preloaded: reset / normalize / a simple grid and some basic objects rendered by variables

The basic dev process is based on Coffee / Pug (Jade) / Sass or Scss. The gulp file 'should' support ejs6, vanilla js, less and stylus but this has not been tested yet.

Note: the process is actually only working for Linux, and has been tested on Debian only... be my guest: start testing it on other platforms and pull some requests ;) !!

## Install

Install with npm:
  ```sh
    npm install -g nawac
  ```

## Usage

Run creation process:
  ```sh
    nawac
  ```
